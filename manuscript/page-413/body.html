<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I did not attempt to stand up. It seemed to me that my body must be suddenly changed to lead. Mother Earth had her grip on me nowâ€”no Cavorite intervening. I sat down heedless of the water that came over my feet.</p><p>It was dawn, a gray dawn, rather overcast but showing here and there a long patch of greenish gray. Some way out a ship was lying at anchor, a pale silhouette of a ship with one yellow light. The water came rippling in in long shallow waves. Away to the right curved the land, a shingle bank with little hovels, and at last a lighthouse, a sailing mark and a point. Inland stretched a space of level sand, broken here and there by pools of water, and ending a mile away perhaps in a low shore of scrub.</p></div> </div>
