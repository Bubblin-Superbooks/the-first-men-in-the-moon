The whole area of the crater seemed to me then to be one similar wilderness up to the very foot of the surrounding cliff.</p><p>This cliff was apparently bare of vegetation save at its base, and with buttresses and terraces and platforms that did not very greatly attract our attention at the time. It was many miles away from us in every direction; we seemed to be almost at the centre of the crater, and we saw it through a certain haziness that drove before the wind.</p></div> </div>
