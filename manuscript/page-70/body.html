He had had intimations of it before, but at the time it seemed to come to him in a rush. We were returning to the bungalow for tea, and on the way he fell humming. Suddenly he shouted, "That's it! That finishes it! A sort of roller blind!"</p><p>"Finishes what?" I asked.</p><p>"Space—anywhere! The moon."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Mean? Why—it must be a sphere! That's what I mean!"</p></div> </div>
