<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I shouldered my golden clubs, one on each shoulder, and went on out of the ravine of the gold-veined rocks.</p><p>The sun was certainly lower, much lower than it had been; the air was very much cooler. I perceived I must have slept some time. It seemed to me that a faint touch of misty blueness hung about the western cliff I leapt to a little boss of rock and surveyed the crater. I could see no signs of mooncalves or Selenites, nor could I see Cavor, but I could see my handkerchief far off, spread out on its thicket of thorns. I looked bout me, and then leapt forward to the next convenient view-point.</p></div> </div>
