Our tunnel was expanding into a cavern, and this new light was at the farther end of it. I perceived something that set my hopes leaping and bounding.</p><p>"Cavor," I said, "it comes from above! I am certain it comes from above!"</p><p>He made no answer, but hurried on.</p><p>Indisputably it was a gray light, a silvery light.</p><p>In another moment we were beneath it. It filtered down through a chink in the walls of the cavern, and as I stared up, drip, came a drop of water upon my face.
