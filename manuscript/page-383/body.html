<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A cold wind set all the crater shivering. Suddenly, for a moment, I was in a puff of falling snow, and all the world about me gray and dim.</p><p>And then it was I heard, not loud and penetrating as at first, but faint and dim like a dying voice, that tolling, that same tolling that had welcomed the coming of the day: Boom!… Boom!… Boom!…</p><p>It echoed about the crater, it seemed to throb with the throbbing of the greater stars, the blood-red crescent of the sun's disc sank as it tolled out: Boom!… Boom!… Boom!…</p><p>What had happened to Cavor? All through that tolling I stood there stupidly, and at last the tolling ceased.</p></div> </div>
