The thrust of my foot that I made in striding would have carried me a yard on earth; on the moon it carried me sixâ€”a good five yards over the edge.

For while one falls sixteen feet in the first second of a fall on earth, on the moon one falls two, and with only a sixth of one's weight. I fell, or rather I jumped down, about ten yards I suppose. It seemed to take quite a long time, five or six seconds, I should think. I floated through the air and fell like a feather, knee-deep in a snow-drift in the bottom of a gully of blue-gray, white-veined rock.</p></div> </div>
